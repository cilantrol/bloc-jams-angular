when to use object vs array? in a controller property
  for angular to store information?
  because ng-repeat cycles through arrays?
  .push vs property: {}

how to use a controller properly?  syntaxing?
why exactly is this preferred?

  (function (){
    function "controller name"($scope){
      $scope.prop1: blah,
      $scope.prop2: blahblah
      if we use 'this'.prop1 here it will refer to the argument passed in?
    }

    angular
    .module("appname")
    .controller("controller name referred in app.js ",actual function "controller name");

  })();

vs
app.controller('controller name', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.prop1: blah,
  $scope.prop2: blahblah
});


ng-repeat=" key in object/array"
    this seems similar to a for in loop
    i never really understood the concept of it because the 'key' can be named anything really such as property in properties or x in properties
    or even key in properties, basically the name doesnt matter as long as we what declare in the directives line up {{ property.name }}


what does not manipulating the DOM in a controller look like?
  we want the controller to be as clean as possible with only 1 purpose

how to use jquery with angular?
 is it a pick and choose or can both coexist?
 angular is for light loading webpages that do not contain a lot of information?
 why do transition properties not work on angular?
 jQuery is more for animations and and more data heavy? and/or DOM manipulation?
